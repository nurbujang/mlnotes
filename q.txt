1. 
y.shape (6,) means?
y.ndim 1 means?
but x needs to be 2d array, why? always reshape x? x>1
whrn to know when to reshape x? and when not to reshape y?
predictions = w0 + np.dot(w1,X).reshape(1,-1) why reshape predictions?
regression is always y,pred?
check cars, diabetes

2
pg 6 - pred= predicted y?y
A=Z Cross validation example
try and stop at how many variables?
just pick randomly?

3
get ypredproba everytime after predictions?

notebook 3 survives/not?:
    split test train
    algo model
    fit with train
    get ytrainpredict, ytrainproba
    get xtrain, y train score

notebook 3 make predictions:
    get ytestpredict, ytestproba
    xtest, ytest score

Join new predictions and probabilities into original dataset
    ypredicted, ypredproba


4
cross-validation to find  best kfold value?
when to do feature scaling? - pick and choose?
make_pipeline, functiontransformer, minmaxscaler
